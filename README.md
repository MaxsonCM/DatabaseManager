# DatabaseManager
 A simple database manager made to replace conventional paid tools. 
 The initial proposal was to replace Microsoft Access.
 
### Why ?

The company where I work uses most of the time Microsoft Access databases and in several different versions. So depending on the version of Access database manager the oldest databases cannot be changed in the newest versions. That program proposes helping with that limitation.
