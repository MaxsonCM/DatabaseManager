# DatabaseManager
 A simple database manager made to replace conventional paid tools. 
 The initial proposal was to replace Microsoft Access.
 
### Why a database manager?

The company where I work uses most of the time Microsoft Access databases and in several different versions. So depending on the version of Access database manager the oldest databases cannot be changed in the newest versions. That program proposes helping with that limitation.
 
### Why was made in VB.Net language?

That was the language where I had work most time of my career. And I can make that tool in my free time and as fast I can, without worry about that new technologies were a have no knowledge, that could turn the development of this software very slow. And I wanted a project in that language on my portfolio.

### Functionalities:
* List all tables
* List all tables fields
* List all indexes

* Manipulate tables
* Manipulate field
